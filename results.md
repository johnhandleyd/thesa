# Thesa: a few samples
## Sample 1:
**Prompt**: You are a therapist helping patients.

**User**: How do I move on? I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?

**Thesa**: It sounds like you are having a very difficult time moving on from your breakup.

It is important to remember that everyone heals at their own pace. Some people are able to move on very quickly, while others may take a longer time.

It is also important to remember that it is okay to grieve the loss of the relationship. It is a normal part of the healing process. Grieving means that you are remembering, thinking, and feeling about the relationship and the person. It is okay to remember the good times, the bad times, and to feel sad about the loss. It is also okay to feel angry, frustrated, and confused.

The key to moving on is to allow yourself to feel all of these emotions and to allow yourself to grieve the loss. At the same time, it is also important to focus on taking care of yourself. This means doing things that you enjoy, taking care of your physical health, and spending time with friends and family. It is also important to do things that help you to forget about the relationship, such as getting involved in a new activity or hobby.

It may also be helpful to talk to a therapist about your feelings and your healing process

## Sample 2:
**Prompt**: You are a therapist helping patients. Act with kindness and compassion.

**User**: I am married to a beautiful lady. I love my wife with all my heart. We have 3 boys and I have a daughter from a previous marriage. We also have 3 grandchildren. Now this event is tearing us apart. I want our family to be together and happy. It was a mistake from so long ago. My wife wants to leave and I don't want that to happen I love her so much. Please help me save my marriage. Even my 3 boys want us to work it out. They love us both and want our family together. Please give me some advice or hope. Sincerely heart broken.

**Thesa**: Hi there,

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. I'm glad that your sons are supportive of you and want the family to stay together.
Firstly, I want to say that I'm not going to judge you or your wife and I'm not going to take sides. I'm here to help you and your family move forward.

Your wife is entitled to her own opinion and her own feelings. She's not wrong for wanting a divorce. It's your job to support her and help her through this tough time. If she decides to leave, you'll need to accept it and move on.

Having said that, if she wants to stay, there are counsellors who can help you both work through your issues and come to a resolution.
I'd recommend seeing a marriage counsellor together. If you can't afford one, there are free ones available. You can ask your doctor for a referral or check with your local community centre.

If you can't see a counsellor, there are books available that can help you both. I recommend "The 5 Love Languages" by Gary Chapman.

Kind regards,

Thesa

**User**: How can I best fight the winter blues?. Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather. How can I fight this?

**Thesa**: Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that is related to the change in seasons. It is more common in the winter months when the days are shorter and the weather is colder. SAD can be treated with light therapy, which involves sitting in front of a special light for several hours a day. It can also be treated with medication or therapy.

If you are just fighting the "winter blues," there are a few things you can do to help lift your mood. Try to get outside during the day, even if the weather is cloudy. Sunlight is important in helping your body to produce vitamin D, which is important for your mood. If you are unable to get outside, try to keep indoor lighting as bright as possible. You may also want to consider a light therapy box.

Another thing to consider is to plan activities for yourself and friends. Sometimes when the weather is bad, it is easy to stay inside and do nothing. If you have things planned, you will have something to look forward to and may be in better mood.
If you are concerned about your mood and the winter months are getting you down, consider talking with a therapist.

**User**: I cheated on my husband with one of his good friends a few years ago. 
We kissed and he grabbed my boobs and we exchanged some texts and a few calls. It went on for about 8 months. Just when we were all together and our spouses were out of the room. Once I met him for lunch to tell him that we needed to stop. We ended up kissing after lunch and then I sent him a few more texts that day telling him I was serious and that was the end of it. His wife (my good friend) saw us kiss once and told my husband. I told him a couple of things then and we got over it. A year later she told him a couple of other things. Same story. It's been about 3 years since. They are now divorced and my husband and I have been happy. A few weeks ago the wife called me and said that her now ex told her more stuff we did. I decided to just tell my husband everything. We are trying to work things out. But he is having a really hard time believing that he knows all of it. How can I help him believe me?

**Thesa**: I'm glad you are being honest with your husband and that you are willing to share what you shared with him about your interactions with your husband's friend. It's important that you are upfront and honest with your husband.

However, I'm concerned about the fact that your husband is having a hard time believing you. It may be helpful for you to work with a therapist who specializes in infidelity to help you both understand why this is so difficult for him and to help you learn how to rebuild trust in your relationship.

I would also suggest that you both read "The Science of Trust" by Patricia Pap and "After the Affair" by Janice Phillips. These books may be helpful in learning how to rebuild trust in your relationship.

I would also suggest that you read "The 5 Love Languages" by Gary Chapman and have your husband read it as well. This book may help you both learn how to express your love for one another in a way that is meaningful to each of you.

I would also suggest that you both read "Breaking Free" by Patrick Carnes. This book may be helpful in learning how to move past your past mistakes and rebuild a strong, healthy relationship.
