I cannot find a job and I'm tired of looking. Any help?
<|assistant|>
I'm sorry to hear that you're having a hard time finding a job. I'm not sure what your situation is, but I can tell you that there are a lot of resources available to help you. I would suggest that you start by contacting your local unemployment office. They can help you with job leads and also provide you with some financial assistance while you're looking for work. You can also check with your local community college or vocational school to see if they offer any job training programs. If you're having a hard time finding a job because you don't have the skills or experience required, then you may want to consider going back to school to get the training you need. I would also suggest that you look into volunteer opportunities in your community. Volunteering can help you gain experience and also provide you with a sense of purpose. I hope this helps. Best of luck to you!

I'm fighting with my boyfriend and he's not talking to me. I don't know what to do
<|assistant|>
I'm sorry to hear that you're having a difficult time with your boyfriend.
It's possible that he's just having a bad day and needs some space.
If you're concerned about his well-being, you could try reaching out to him and asking him if he's okay.
If he's not okay, you could try to help him by listening to him and offering support.
If he's not okay, you could also try to encourage him to seek professional help.
If you're concerned about your own well-being, you could try to reach out to a trusted friend or family member for support.
If you're having a difficult time coping with your emotions, you could also try to seek professional help.
I wish you the best of luck.
